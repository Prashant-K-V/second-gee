A Magician know, how to take your consent.Everyone want something, as soon as you offer what other need, you can control other person decision making process. (SAAM, DAAM)If nothing work, than fear make person comply to other person need. (DAND, BHED)Solution could be to make your child wise, and teach the ways in which other person can control him.But before that teach your child with utmost awareness about goodness of life, power of knowledge, significance of trust/love, importance of self excellance (TAPA), correct way of helping needy (DANA), way to align and help good  wise superiors (YAGYA).Once soul is purified, then teach him about weakness of body, mind and how to protect them from manipulation by others (MAYA). teach only defensive mode.Sooner or later, being wise he/she will figure out how to convert defensive to offensive mode, as all bodies  mind have same weaknesses.That is why soul purification is important, so that even if he/she choose to use that knowledge to mould other, he always be in the side of goodness rather then evilness. Mould other to help him, help society, and not to use them for your own selfishness. This is called true education, never ever make evil wise, even if he/she your own son/daughter.First Knowledge, Then Weakness, Then Wisdom.Ajeet YadavI am good right now, thanks
