They should know that whenever someone asks them to do something, they have an option to respond in the way they feel comfortable. Dont want to go for a night out? Say No. Dont want to sit on a relatives lap? Say No. True consent means that they havent been coerced to give in to the request, feel free from any threat and do not face any power imbalance.
