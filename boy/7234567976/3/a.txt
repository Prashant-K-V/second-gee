Overweight people have an increased risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and other illnesses. Losing weight reduces the risk. However, losing weight is more easily said than done. This is surely a universal truth. The flab seems to stick on by default and as and when you try to get rid of the same, you simple seem to be driving uphill without much support. Thus the repeated efforts leave all your enthusiasm futile and you are exasperated and simply discouraged. This is where ancient holistic fitness therapies of yoga and pranayama come for aid.
