 Yoga is absolutely a gift to humanity from our ancestors. In yoga therapy, asanas are not practiced for the sake of burning extra calories, but to develop body awareness, to understand the language of body, the way it works, and what suits it best. Even though the aim of yoga is not just for weight loss, this is bound to happen as an outcome of our increased self-awareness. However, one must remember 3 Ds i.e. Discipline, Determination and Dedication in reducing weight naturally and allow his or her awareness to develop in a positive and constructive manner.
