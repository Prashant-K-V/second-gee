: I am a 44-year-old divorcee and am in love with my sons class teacher. She is in her mid-thirties and still single. I have met her a few times outside his school and we seem to share a good chemistry. She knows about my feelings and has shown interest in sharing a future together. However, we both are worried about our son, who is a teenager and doesnt take things too easily these days. Moreover, she is also worried that dating a parent of her student might be unethical. We do not know how to take this forward. Please help.

In your situation, it seems clear that you and your partner are on the same equation. While you are hopeful about having a future together, its completely natural to feel worried about your teenage son who might be caught off guard with the whole scenario. The first thing to move forward with your relationship is to sensitise your child about the idea of your relationship with his teacher. Floating the idea may give you a bent towards how his reaction may be towards accepting her. 

Therefore, before taking the next step, its important to check if everything is alright at your home. 

If everything seems to sail smoothly, you can even request your partner to consider changing her school if she wishes to, as it may make things easier for her.
