When days are short and nights are long, when food is sparse and air is poisoned, you are the hope that keeps me alive. I grew up in your arms as a child. As I grew, I found a partner in you. You gave me a shoulder to cry on when I needed a friend. You gave me life, you are my life. Happy Womens Day.
