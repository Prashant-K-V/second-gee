Because you are women, people will force their thinking on you, their boundaries on you. They will tell you how to dress, how to behave, who you can meet and where you can go. Dont live in the shadows of peoples judgement. Make your own choices in the light of your own wisdom. Amitabh BachchanAmitabh Bachchan
