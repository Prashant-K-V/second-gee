Abortion is murder. Life enters into the womans egg via the sperm at the time of copulation. As soon as the egg is fertilized by the sperm the living person is there in the egg. The egg then gradually develops with time. Any abortion of the fertilized egg is murder. Those who commit abortion are guilty of murder and strict laws should be enacted and enforced against abortionists. Those who commit abortion will roast in the fire of hell in which they will not believe till they experience it.Vimal Sehgal
