To give you a background, during the early days of World War II, Navy noticed that they were losing their pilots because of sleep deprivation. The pilots were overworked as well as over stressed and were ending up taking the wrong decisions on field. Llyod Winter who was considered the best sprint coach in history, devised a special plan to combat the issue at hand. He divided their sleep cycle in two parts - physical relaxation and mental relaxation. He coached the pilots in practicing them both and after six weeks of practice, they were able to slip into sleep in less than 2 minutes - anywhere, anytime.
