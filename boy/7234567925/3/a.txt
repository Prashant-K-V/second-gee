So what is the trick really? The two-phase method is easy but requires some practice to master. The physical relaxation part involved the person to sit on a chair (because it is tougher to drift off to sleep than in a bed). The person was asked to sit straight on a chair with feet on the ground. He was then asked to close his eyes and let his head droop, such that his chin rests on the chest. He then practiced patterned regular breathing. He was told to consciously relax his facial muscles, relax the brows, loosen his tongue and allow the jaw to fall; then feel his body become weightless and also relax his thigh muscles, calves and feet, the whole body.
