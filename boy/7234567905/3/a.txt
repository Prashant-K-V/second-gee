Wearing clean, breathable clothes is a key to keeping back acne away. Ensure you wash your clothes after you wear them, especially the ones youre wearing for a workout. Also, be mindful of fabrics that are touching your back daily (like bed covers, towels, any kind of linen) and wash them at least once a week. This will keep your back bacteria free.
