“Before I met you, I was just living my life. But the moment our eyes met, I died a thousand deaths. And every time I was reborn, I wanted to breath my last wrapped in your arms. I want to make soft and tender love this night and welcome 2018 lying in your arms. The New Year only gets better when I am with you.”
