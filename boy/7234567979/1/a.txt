The business startup 
competition
Since Bengaluru is known as the startup capital of India, the organisers conducted a startup competition to recognise such talent from different colleges. There were 15 business plans exhibited at this event, where students proposed their ideas and had to defend the same to the judges. Students were judged on the basis of their creativity, innovation, invention, negotiations with financial institutions, effective presentations and uniqueness of the plan. 
The idea of an ambulance app, which ensures immediate availability of an ambulance facility at the emergency site was proposed by Nithik Roshan, Hriclai Ray, Mu Faddal and Yashvardhan of Jain (Deemed-to-be) University, bagged the first place. The second place was given to Al Ameen College for their Bluetooth pepper spray idea. However, it was St. Claret College that took home the overall championship trophy.
