 Grow glandular flowers in shade and dont water them too much. Exotic plants need a lot of tedious care but they add colour to the surrounding. Their seeds are costly, so once you have planted them, dry the seeds. Preserve them in an air tight container to be used in the next season. Weed out regularly and sow a citronella plant to keep mosquitoes at bay.
