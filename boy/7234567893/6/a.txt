If the phobia is affecting your day to day life, its time to get in touch with a trained specialist. Like many other phobia and psychotic disorders, your fear of dolls is curable too. A treatment plan would likely involve exposure, “which is a gradual confrontation with feared stimuli,” psychologists say. Someone might start by being in the same room as a doll, and eventually work up to holding a variety of different dolls in their hands.
