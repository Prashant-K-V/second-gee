For many, dolls and their counterpart robots are very friendly and human-like but not exactly real. There is a fear that they might soon replace them. Scientists refer to this as “uncanny valley” as dolls are fashioned to be animated and real like humans but at the same time, they are not quite human and this makes many uncomfortable. If facing this phobia, it can also transport the same trigger on to other things, such as windows, the food we eat. This is because our brains are trained in a way to reach faces for vital clues, emotions and intentions as well as threats. When we see something scary in a lifelike doll, we register it as a threat to ourselves and start seeing it around us all the time.
