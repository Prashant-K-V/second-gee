Fear of dolls is irrational. There are many, who may like them and play with them as a child but the same thing can give them some unhappy memories as an adult. As researchers and psychologists point out, it isnt necessarily the dolls themselves which scare people but placing them next to other fear-inducing stimuli triggers people. In other cases, movies and social environment can also influence fear. So, if you see a horror movie involving dolls, you might over the years develop the same fear as well.
