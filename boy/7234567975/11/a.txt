The emergence of this creative art can be attributed to Hindu mythological literature works. The word rangoli is a derivation of the Sanskrit word rangavalli and signifies a creative expression of art by the means of colours. Rangoli is also considered a lucky omen. However, traditional rangoli designs were two-dimensional; the modern three dimensional designs are attractive too.
