Named after the popular art of Mandana paintings, this kind of Rangoli is native to the areas of Rajasthan. Mandana is drawn to protect health, welcome gods and mark the celebration of festivals. Mandana is basically drawn using chalk powder. Women draw this beautiful piece of art form with the help of a piece of cotton, a tuft of hair or a rudimentary brush made out of a date stick.
