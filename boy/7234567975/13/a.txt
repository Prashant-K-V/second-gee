It is the freehand art that makes it more creative and fun. A traditional design can find a modern parallel depending on the creativity of the artist. Modern-day rangolis look mesmerizing with the inclusion of various embellishments. Flowers, petals, glitters, paints and stickers make the art form even more beautiful. Special patterns are created on the festival of Diwali and when the rangoli is decorated with lighted diyas, it looks stunning.
