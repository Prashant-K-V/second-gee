Rangoli art is a traditional form of welcoming good luck and its popularity has remained unaffected over the years. Rangoli competitions are one of the most popular activities during festivals. Rangoli is a spiritual distribution of colours and thus is considered a harbinger of good luck. Most of the rangoli designs maintain symmetry like a yin and yang symbol or a swastika. And, worldwide, across all religions, symmetrical designs are considered as a symbol of prosperity, luck and growth.
