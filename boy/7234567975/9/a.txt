Aripana patterns are integral to almost every celebration in a Bihari household. Drawn in the courtyard or the entrance, any ritual or celebration is considered incomplete without aripana in Bihar. Traditionally, aripanas were drawn to make the cultivated land fertile and fruitful by magical performances. Made with fingers, the delicate designs are made with the help of rice paste or pittha.
