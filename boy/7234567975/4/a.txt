Kolam was traditionally drawn using rice flour or chalk powder. With modern times, use of synthetic coloured powders is also used. Native to Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerela and some parts of Goa, traditionally, the main purpose of Kolam was not decoration. Earlier, Kolams were drawn in coarse rice flour so that the ants would not have to walk too far for a meal. Along with ants, Kolam encouraged harmonious existence by setting an invitation to birds and other small creatures for a meal.
