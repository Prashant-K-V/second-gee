This traditional art is known as Jhoti or Chita in Odisha. Unlike in other areas, jhoti can also be drawn on walls as well and is traditionally a line art drawing. The white colour os obtained from a semi-liquid paste of rice flour to draw this traditional line art. Apart from several designs and patterns used in jhoti, small foot marks of goddess Lakshmi are a must. It is highly symbolic and meaningful. Jhoti was drawn by women of the house to establish a relationship between the mystical and the material.
