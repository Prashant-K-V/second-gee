HPS are rocks or solid pieces of Himalayan Pink Salt fixed with a bulb or LED inside. Once the bulb is switched on, it glows in pink or orange colour giving it a very warm look. The salt rocks come from the Himalayan mountains in the Punjab region of Pakistan, they are called Himalayan Salt. As believed, these lamps create negative ions which increase the flow of oxygen to the brain resulting in improved mental energy. But as they absorb water content from the air, it also absorbs the bacteria and micro-particles to it. Hence it is recommended that the lamp is wiped with dry cloth a few times every week.
