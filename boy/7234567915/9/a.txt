Himalayan Salt Lamps act like our lungs. They absorb the moisture from the air and absorb unwanted content from it. Then, as the salt particles heat up, they release the clean water particles back in the environment, purifying the air quality around you. So, if you are living in an area where humidity is high, the salt lamps are bound to sweat (since they are loaded with impure water contents). To avoid this, you can leave the HPS lamps on 24 X 7 so that they are left dry all the time. If you do not want to leave it on for the entire day, look for a less humid area in your home to place the lamp. Avoid areas close to bath, kitchen and laundry.
