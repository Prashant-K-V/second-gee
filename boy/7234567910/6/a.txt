Neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield conducted a research in 2009 that showed reading is good for our mental and physical health. The study revealed that a readers brain can actually experience the sound, scenery, smell and taste that are described in the pages of a book.  Oxford professor John Stein also found out that regular reading makes our brains function better.
