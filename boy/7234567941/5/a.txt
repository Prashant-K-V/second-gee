Neuroendocrine tumour, or shortened as NET, is basically a condition in which an abnormal tissue growth arises in the hormone producing nervous cells (or neuroendocrine cells) of the body. NET may develop slowly or aggressively and can develop in the intestines, where they are the most common, in the lungs, pancreas or anywhere in the rest of the body. After development, the tumour may spread to other body parts.
