Reverse crunch: When wondering how to lose belly fat for women, reverse crunches can be your solution. 

-Lie flat on the floor with arms at your sides
-Cross your feet and lift them off the floor so your knees create a 90-degree angle
-Contract ab muscles and lift head and shoulders off the ground
-Exhale when you contract; inhale when you lower back down
-Do 1-3 sets with 12-16 repetitions
