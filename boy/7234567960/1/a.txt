Running or walking: As you exercise, calories are burned and your body fat percentage decreases. So, exercising not only helps you to reduce belly fat, it also sheds fat from other areas. Running and walking are two of the best fat-burning exercises. Plus, the only equipment you need is a good pair of shoes. Between the two, running burns more calories, but walking really isnt too far behind.
