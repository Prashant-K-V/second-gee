Elliptical trainer: Wondering how to lose tummy fat with elliptical trainers? Some of us no longer have the strong joints we had as teenagers. Jogging is out of the question and walking doesnt cut it. The good news is elliptical trainers provide an intense, low impact cardio workout. Thats about as many calories as running burns, but without the joint wear-and-tear. (Thinkstock Photos/Getty Images)
