Eating fruit and veggies are a great way to consume some hefty doses of nutritional goodness. But, most of them arent blessed with good protein content. Together they carry decent nutritional value, and almost all of them have at least some content of protein as well. But overall, fruit and veggies are not a famous go-to source of protein. However, there are a few protein-rich veggies and fruit that can help. Vegetables such as broccoli, artichokes, spinach, asparagus, sweet potatoes and Brussels sprouts are sources of protein. While fresh fruit may not be known for protein content, guava, nectarines, blackberries, cherimoyas, mulberries and bananas all have about 24 grams of protein per cup.
