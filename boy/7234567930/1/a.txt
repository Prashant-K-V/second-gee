It is a well-known fact that a healthy and wholesome diet can do wonders for your body as well as your mind. Every component of a well balanced diet, which includes carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals, are necessary to achieve the ultimate goal of being healthy. But lets be real for a second here. We all know that taking time out to hit the gym or even a casual morning walk is often near impossible. In the circle of life which revolves around home-work-home, filling the tummy takes precedence over having a balanced diet. Hence, most of us do tend to divulge into food that is readily available, ergo the evolution of junk food. But guess what, if you add the people who have a particular dietary preference in the mix, the situation turns verychallenging, very fast. And to be honest, it is vegetarians who can suffer the most. While most of the nutrients can be extracted from non-living sources, sometimes it is proteins that doesnt get an adequate place on their plate.
