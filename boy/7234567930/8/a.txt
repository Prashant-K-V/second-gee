One of the easiest ways to add protein to your diet is by consuming nuts, seeds and their kinds of butter. Nuts are a nutrient-rich, easy way to add plant protein, vitamins and minerals to your diet. However, before you add them to your diet, make sure they are not roasted or salted; eating them raw is how you extract the maximum nutrient content. Other than being rich in protein, nuts and seeds have plenty of fibre and healthy fats as well. If you need more convincing, nuts pack goodness of iron, vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, selenium, and phosphorus. And to top it off, they pack antioxidants as well.
