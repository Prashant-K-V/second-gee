The most auspicious nine days for Hindu devotees start tomorrow, October 10 th. These nine days are celebrated in various ways across the country. These are days when you wish and pray for the well-being and prosperity of your family and friends. The fierce form of Maa Shakti or Goddess Durga protects us from all evil and vicious and we pray to her to shower her blessings and protect us all our lives. She is believed to visit our homes every year during these nine days to cleanse our abode.
