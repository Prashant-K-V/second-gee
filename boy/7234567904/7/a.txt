Recommended By Colombia Taking a late-night shower and hitting your bed immediately after that can wreak havoc on your tresses next morning. Damp hair is more prone to frizz, and ergo, can cause hair breakage. Plus, you may face humongous trouble styling them next morning as sleeping on wet hair can create funny waves, flat sides and crinkles.
