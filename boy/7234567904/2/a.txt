 Ditch your regular cotton pillow and replace it with a silk one. Cotton pillows roughen up your hair cuticles, and in turn, entangle them. On the other hand, silk ones cause much less friction and help to maintain their natural sheen. P.S. - Silk is a skin-friendly fabric, and helps in preventing skin lines and wrinkles.
