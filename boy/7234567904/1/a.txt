Inner wear is finally getting its due. And with athleisure getting stronger, the ganji aka fashion avatar of the humble banian is becoming a mainstream staple for men and women. The charm of the ganji lies in its casualness. Designer Nikhil Thampi calls it the ultimate closet essential. “One of the best things about ganjis is that they are available in so many different colours and styles that you can build a whole collection  and mix and match them with tons of other items in your wardrobe,” he adds. 
For designer Aniket Satam, a ganji has moved beyond being just a holiday essential. From gyms and beaches to casual Sunday brunches and dressy parties, ganjis are becoming an integral part of our clothing culture, especially considering our tropical weather.

The classic ganji now comes in different lengths and fits. “Today, they can be body-hugging or loose and laid-back. This gives you a variety of options. There is also the choice to either wear the ganji in its basic form or opt for a more layered and fusion look that gives it more depth and versatility,” says designer Hemant Sagar. 
The best bit about ganjis is that its a basic piece of clothing and hence can be deployed effectively to create multiple standout looks. Designer Pria Kataaria Puri suggests experimenting with it. For a comfortable day outfit, she suggests comfy jeans with it and cute sneakers. For cooler days, throw on a warm jacket or jumper. Layer them underneath your oversized or low-neck tops for a funky yet stylish look, suggests Puri. 

Designer Karn Malhotra feels the ganji is a style chameleon as it can be dressed up or down. In fact, you can even wear it as a saree blouse or with a flared lehenga skirt for a DeBo (desi bohemian) look. Designer Arpita Mehta says that her favourite ganji look is to tuck it in a pair of high-waisted pants and team it with layers of slim gold chains in the neck. “Its simple and understated yet looks so chic. For dressier occasions or party nights, a stylish racer back can be paired with a short skirt and stilettoes,” she adds. So get your ganji today.
