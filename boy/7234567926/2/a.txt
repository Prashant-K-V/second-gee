 Believe it or not, many people (and this includes women) dont kiss their partner when theyre having sex. Why? Perhaps because the positioning doesnt allow for it or they are too eager to climax and feel that it might break the rhythm. Nevertheless, it is highly recommended that you make an effort to kiss your partner during the act  it will only add to the experience.
