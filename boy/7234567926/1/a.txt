Wooden tables look stylish and suave and are easy to maintain too. But one of the major issues that can crop up apart from the chipping of wood is the formation of white heat marks. These marks form up when either too hot or too cold mugs or glasses are kept on the table directly. And while you feel the mark would get evaporated after a while, they stay almost forever to disturb the beauty of your table. But here is a trick that can fix it and it is extremely easy to do

When you keep any hot dish on the table without a coaster, the heat seeps in the upper thin layer of furnish and settles inside it unable to move further down or evaporate. Since it gets stuck between the layers, it becomes like a permanent mark. 

If we follow the logic, we need to move this fog gently and make it evaporate slowly by applying heat.

Take a hand towel and steam iron. Fill your steam iron with water and set it on medium heat. Place the towel on the mark and press the iron gently on it. Keep the iron pressed for about 15 seconds but do not press it for long, keep moving it.
