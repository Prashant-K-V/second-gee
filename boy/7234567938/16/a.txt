Mountbatten later also claimed that, “the date I chose came out of the blue. I chose it in reply to a question. I was determined to show I was master of the whole event. When they asked had we set a date, I knew it had to be soon. I hadnt worked it out exactly then  I thought it had to be about August or September and I then went out to the 15 th August. Why? Because it was the second anniversary of Japans surrender.”
