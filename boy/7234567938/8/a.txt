“My in-laws and I have completely different spending and saving habits. I am not a spendthrift but I earn and like shopping. On the other hand, they save every penny wherever possible. Needless to say, they raise eyebrows whenever they see a shopping bag in my hand or when my online order arrives. They leave no opportunity to mock at me for my shopping habits. Now, I have started ordering stuff at my office address.”(All images used here are representational)
