“My mother-in-law is a nice woman and loves to do every household chore to perfection. According to her, there should not be a speck of dust on the TV screen, every cupboard of the house must be organised, all the utensils must be cleaned the moment they are used, every dish should be cooked as per her likingher list of specifications is endless. She is great at her job but she expects the same from me. I have a nine-to-five job and I cannot imagine myself slogging at home like this every evening. Hence, we often end up arguing and my poor husband gets upset.”
