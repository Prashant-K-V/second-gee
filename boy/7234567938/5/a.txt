“The first year of my marriage was not-so-good. It was an arranged marriage and my sister-in-law used to instigate my husband against me. From my dressing sense to cooking skills, she had a negative opinion about everything. Initially, my husband used to get influenced but with time, we understood each other better. One day, he politely asked my sister-in-law to stop being so opinionated.”
