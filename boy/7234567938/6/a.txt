“My wife shares her problems with her best friend. I do not have a problem with that but what really worries me is when my wife follows her advice without a thought. She is not married and does not understand the complexities of a married life. Not just this, she comes to our house unannounced almost every weekend, the only time my wife and I spend quality time together, and they talk the entire time. There has to be some limit and I plan to talk to my wife about this.”
