The British parliament commanded Lord Mountbatten to transfer the governing powers to Indian leaders by June 30, 1948. According to C Rajagopalachari, an Indian politician and independence activist, if Lord Mountbatten had waited till June 1948, there would have been no power left to transfer. This was the reason that Mountbatten preponed the date to August 1947 and transferred all the governing powers.
