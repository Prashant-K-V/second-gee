All these messages: wishes, quotes and long ram-kathas, are a good sign though, they show that despite all the negative things we hear about our country many people still have some feeling for the fact that many people fought hard to make us an independent nation built on beliefs by people who managed to think far ahead of their time. So instead of forwarding an opinion, a tricolour emoji, or a gif that that eats up precious space on someones phone, how about you send out something timelessly relevant to our country?
