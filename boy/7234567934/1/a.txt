The first-ever International Friendship Day was celebrated in Paraguay in the year 1958 to honour friends and cherish the special bond one has with their pals. Over the years, the celebrations for Friendship Day has changed vastly- from personalised, handwritten greeting cards and notes to digital messages on social media platforms and emergence of emoticons to express oneself better-- but the essence behind this day still remains the same.
