 8. Eat less: Another big myth for thin people that needs to be busted right way is consuming foods in large quantities to gain weight. Consuming junk foods in huge quantities and assuming that your body will be unaffected by it is foolish. The best way to go about gaining weight is to divide your meals into smaller bits, to avoid unhealthy snacking. It is a better option to go for foods which are nutrient and calorie dense than for foods which are loaded with unhealthy calories. A thin person who indulges in unhealthy eating habits is as prone to lifestyle diseases as any obese person.
