 12. Increase protein intake: The ideal consumption for any body, despite being thin or obese or healthy, is 1 gm/kg. This is the basic requirement which should be fulfilled on a daily basis. Not only will this curb your unnecessary hinger pangs which make you hog on unhealthy foods, but it also helps you maintain a healthy body weight with lean body mass. Proteins are the building blocks of our body and if your body starves of it, it will never be able to achieve its healthiest best. Including tofu, paneer, chicken, and vegetables like spinach will help you get through with your daily protein consumption.
