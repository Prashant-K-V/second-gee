 3. Exercise: The biggest mistake a thin person can make is to think that no food will affect their body. Even the thinnest bodies tend to get an unsightly paunch and it is important to not get to this stage. This is because a paunch simply means that the visceral and the subcutaneous fat in your body are increasing, which is not a healthy sign. Along with this, it is also a sign that you may gradually be leading towards weaker muscles. Therefore, it is important to participate in a mix of cardio, weight training and flexibility enhancing exercises every day.
