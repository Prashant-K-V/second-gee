 6. Healthy diet: The market is loaded with dietary supplements, which may promise you weight gain in no time. But it is important to remember that many of these dietary supplements are full of synthetic nutrients, which may gain weight temporarily but ruin your health permanently. Therefore, consult your nutritionist or family physician before consuming anything. Secondly, these supplements will only come in handy when your diet is in place. Your body requires the right amount of proteins, fats and carbs. Sticking to a healthy diet inclusive of nuts and dairy products and exclusive of alcohol will help you get faster results.
