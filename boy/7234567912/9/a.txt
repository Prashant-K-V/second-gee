The Great Gatsby is my favourite book. I read it when I was 17 or 18, out of school, and was impressed by the story because its a book about a dream  and how people behave when the dream is broken. This is a very important theme for me. I dont think of it as necessarily the American dream, but rather a young mans dream, a dream in general.
