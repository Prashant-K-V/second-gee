Vertical leg crunch: An amazing workout to lose that belly fat. The vertical leg crunch is similar to a regular crunch. But it requires you to keep your legs straight, which makes the abs work harder and increases the workouts intensity.
-Lie down with hands behind your head
-Put your legs straight up with knees crossed
-Flex abs to lift head and shoulders off the floor
-Lay back down
-Keep legs extended in the air the whole time
-Exhale when you flex; inhale when you lay back down
-Do 1-3 sets with 12-16 repetitions
