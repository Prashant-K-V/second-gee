Mint is known for its invigorating scent and refreshing qualities. It can also be used to remove those ugly dark circles under your eyes. Just crush a few leaves with water, forming a paste, and apply on the dark circles. Leave for 10 minutes and wash with cold water. Do this every night for a week to see miraculous results.
