Most cancers are preventable provided people undertake screening regularly say doctors

When cancer cells break away from the primary spot where they were formed and spread to other parts through lymph system or blood, it is known as metastatic cancer. The cancer cells form tumours in other parts of the body, which are known as metastatic tumours. However, both the primary and metastatic cancer are same in nature.

Often, a metastasis occurs in the stage IV (four) of many forms of cancer, says cancer.gov. Metastasis is a serious stage as it means that the cancer was strong enough to spread to other parts of the body. 

Recommended By ColombiaAs metastatic cancer is similar to the primary form of cancer, so, for example, if breast cancer spreads to lungs, it will be called metastatic breast cancer, not lung cancer. The treatment for the metastatic cancer would be like that of stage IV breast cancer.

Because the cancers may be similar in nature, doctors can often fail to locate the primary spot of cancer. Such a diagnosis is known as cancer of unknown primary origin, or CUP.
