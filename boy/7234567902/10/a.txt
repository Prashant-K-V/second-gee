Although depression deaths are hard to battle, the only possible solution to bring or revive a person back to life is pushing them into a situation they feel they can actually control or surround them in a comforting environment. Of course, medical rehabilitation is possible. In such extreme cases, psychologists and medical experts suggest increasing the dopamine levels in the brain. When induced into the brain, the critically low levels are restored back which can try bringing the person back to a normal state of living.
