This is considered as the last stage for a person to go through before actual death happens. The condition can find a person all helpless and alone and feel least bothered by it. Also called voodoo death, the person becomes distraught by the environment around him and refuses to even get up. The time gap between this stage of psychogenic death and actual death itself can be as little as 2-3 days.
