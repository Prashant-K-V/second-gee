 False. If you are going OTT with your exfoliation routine, think again. This skincare regimen is not needed every day or even weekly. In fact, with the advent of products containing newer ingredients the overall need for exfoliation has reduced. Mumbai-based dermatologist Dr Batul Patel mentions that ingredients like monolaurin, present in night creams and cleansers, treats excess sebum without over drying the skin. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) act as chemical exfoliants which help to loosen and remove dead skin cells. “Using these products will in effect reduce the need for exfoliating; in case you still do feel the need, then twice a month is adequate,” she says. Those with sensitive skin, should, especially be careful. People suffering from active acne and rosacea should avoid grainy exfoliators, as they can further complicate the issue.
