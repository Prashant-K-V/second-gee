Your toddler has pooped, you run to her. The pre-teen is having a meltdown, you run to her. The baby spills her milk, you run to her. You handle every small to big issue around the house and outside. You constantly worry that NO ONE CAN TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOUR CHILD THAN YOU and this burden often gets to heavy to shoulder but you do it every single day.
