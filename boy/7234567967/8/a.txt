Try a new perfume: Choosing a different scent than what you normally wear will also amp your look. It is best to choose one according to the occasion you are wearing it for. For example, if you are going for a party in the evening, you can wear something that has a hint of musk. But if you are going for an occasion during the day, it is best to choose something light and fruity.
