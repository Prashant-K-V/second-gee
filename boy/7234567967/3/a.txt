Sternbergh points out the Pew Research done in 1976 to back up his claim, and explained that 40 per cent of women between the age of 40-44 years had four or more kids. Going into further details, 25 per cent of them had three children, 24 per cent had two and just 11 per cent had one. Interestingly, today, a whopping two-third women have just one or two kids.
