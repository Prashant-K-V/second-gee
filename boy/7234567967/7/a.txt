Choose bold colours: With the party season on in full swing, theres no better way to change the way you look than flaunting bright and bold colours in your makeup. You can always opt for a bright red lipstick or do the smokey eye look. Further you can also add bright colours to your hair to make it look funky. Says Manji, “In case you do not wish to colour your hair completely, you can add extensions in bright colours such as purple or fuchsia.”
