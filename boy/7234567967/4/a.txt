This trend is not just limited to the west. Going by the statistics of census of 2011, for the first time in our countrys history, more than half of the families do not have more than two kids. Whoa In fact, the census of 2011 reported that 54 per cent women opted for having two or less kids. Comparing this to the census of 2001, the figure was 46. 6 per centan indication that couples now prefer to have smaller families. Also, there is a dip in average number of children to 2. 69 per cent, the steepest one ever compared to the previous decades. We guess it is safe to assume that all the population-control campaigns are surely showing a positive impact.
