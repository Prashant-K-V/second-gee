Do your hair differently: Instead of getting a haircut done or colouring your hair, you can always tweak your hairstyle a bit to make it look trendy and different. A middle part will lend a symmetrical look to your face, while a deeper side part will make you look mature. Changing your hairstyle is probably the easiest way to spruce up your look. Further you can also go in for a braid or a bun that are perfect options for a makeover.
