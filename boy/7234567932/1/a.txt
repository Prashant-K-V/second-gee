Mithali Dorai Raj, captain of the Indian Womens Cricket Team is undoubtedly one of the greatest to have played for our country. Mithalis dominance over the game is revealed through the records she has achieved over the years. She has played international cricket across all three formats for almost 20 years now and even at 35, theres no stopping her. She is a prime example of what a true champion looks like and to understand her dominance over the game just remember that she is the first  only woman cricketer to have scored more than 6000 runs in WODIs.
