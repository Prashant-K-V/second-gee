McCartney announced on a Youtube video that he will be writing a picture book. The book is called 
Hey Grandude, inspired by what his grandchildren call him. He explained, “Ive got eight grandchildren and theyre all beautiful and one day one of them said to me Hey Grandude. I said What? and I thought, I kind of like that, so from then on I was known as Grandude.”

McCartney thought that it would make a good story and he set to writing it. Its about Grandude, someone who represents grandfathers everywhere. He calls his grandchildren, hillers and they go on adventures together. McCartney says its a book for grandathers and it gives them something to read to their grandchildren.

The singing superstar isnt the only ex-Beatle to write a book for children. Ringo Starr has also written a book named after one of their songs, 
Octopuss Garden, which was published in 2014.

Hey Grandude is illustrated by Kathryn Durst and published by Puffin, Penguin Random Houses childrens book imprint. It will release on September 2019.
