Daughters Day is, as the name clearly says, a day to celebrates our daughters. Different countries celebrate it on different days and in India it is celebrated on the last Sunday of September. This year that falls on 23 rd September.

 Children are a blessing, whether male, female, or other. They should be cherished daily however its nice to take a day out to honour them in particular, after all, there is a mothers day and a fathers day to celebrate parents.

 One shouldnt need a reason to celebrate children or justify a day put aside to celebrate the blessing of a daughter. However, many unjustly patriarchal societies still view female children as inferior to male ones. So governments of some countries, in an attempt to encourage equality, decided to add daughters day as a nationally acknowledged festival. Every citizen is equal in front of the government and law and this thinking needed to be encouraged in the people.

Recommended By Colombia The success of the festival shows how times are changing. People happily celebrate having daughters and daughters day inevitably leads to some form of celebration in families with daughters. As it falls on a Sunday, daughters and parents usually have a holiday on that day and have the day to spend together celebrating. 

Daughters should be given equal treatment by all families specially in rural India.Abhishek Oza

 There can be as many ways to celebrate daughters day as there are families. Parents sometimes write heartfelt cards, letters or messages to their daughters and can accompany it with a gift. The rest of the celebration varies from family to family, depending on the relation between the daughter and parent(s). Some might celebrate with a big family celebration, while others with a small personal affair. There could be an outing or maybe the daughter will celebrate with each parent individually.

 It should be up to the daughter to choose how she wants to celebrate with her family.
