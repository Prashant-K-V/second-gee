If you love to experiment and want to stand out, try the white mehndi art. Unlike the natural henna which leaves the colour on the skin, the white henna can be easily washed off. From adhesive to body paints, there are different forms of paste used for white henna. Artists seal this art with glitter and gilding powder. These pastes can stay on the skin for 3 to 10 days.
