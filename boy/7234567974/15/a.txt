Mehndi is one the main tradition for Hindu weddings. Brides usually go for intricate and heavy designs for the wedding. And now the latest trend involves getting a portrait of their husband or even the couple drawn on the palms. This design is not a free-hand drawing, the sketch is made 3-4 days before and artists use a decal to recreate the portraits, which looks pretty much like a painting. Its one of the most different and beautiful mehndi for brides.
