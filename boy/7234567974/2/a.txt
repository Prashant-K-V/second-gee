Mehndi is also a tradition for weddings and many festivals in India like Karva Chauth, Diwali, Teej and Eid. The decorative design is usually drawn on the palm and back of the hand. The colour of the mehndi depends on the henna paste; it varies from cheery red to dark brown. Indian henna art features fine lines of designs like flowers, petals, leaves and heavy intricate work.
