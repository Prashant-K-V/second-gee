Considered to be Nathaniel Hawthornes masterwork, it is a moving tale of a woman.
Though it was written in 1850 the story is set in the 1640 s and it explores the social stigma of adutery. Adultery was crime then and the tale starts with a pregnant woman being punished for her crime. As the tale goes on we learn about her long lost husband, her lover and his guilt. Its a tale of love, lust but mostly public sentiment and how that affects relations.
