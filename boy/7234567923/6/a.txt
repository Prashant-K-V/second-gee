 D.H Lawrences explosive book got a lot of backlash when it published due to its frank portrayal of sexuality and an adulterous affair. It was even banned as pornography until 1960 Lady Chatterleys Lover follows Constance Reid, wife of a wealthy, paralysed war veteran, who indulges in an affair with their gamekeeper, Oliver Mellors. The novel basically focuses on Constances realization that she cannot control her mind and respect alone cannot satisfy her physical need.
