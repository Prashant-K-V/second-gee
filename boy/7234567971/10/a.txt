 Delhi-based Samir Parikh, director, department of mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Hospital explains, “Teenagers are anyway undergoing internal struggle, facing questions like Who am I? Do people like me? Do my friends find me good enough? Am I lonely? They are the best targets for such games that look out for vulnerable teens who seek acceptance, acknowledgement and attention from peers.” Leading ahead in such games that dares you with tasks offers a boost to self-esteem and sends positive strokes. And in that adrenaline rush, they forget that its coming at the cost of their lives.
