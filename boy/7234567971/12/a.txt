Dr Seema shares, “Many teens come to me complaining about loneliness. They complain their parents are too busy for them and they have no friends. I recently had a 16-year-old come to me complaining he doesnt want to live because no one likes him. These are the same kids who are searching painless deaths on Google. They go to suicide forums. This makes it extremely crucial for the parents to pay attention to their kids.”
