 This has something to do with the life spans of the female egg and the male sperm. Once an egg is released from the ovary  a stage also known as ovulation  it begins its path down the fallopian tube to the uterus. A released egg typically survives for only 24 hours, while a sperm can last anywhere from three to five days in the female body. As such, the egg has to be as close to the egg as possible so they can meet and join before the egg dies.
