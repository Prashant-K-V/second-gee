BBT is your lowest body temperature in a 24-hour cycle. To know the ovulation period, you have to record your bodys temperature every morning. The day after you ovulate, there will be a slight increase in your bodys temperature which will be somewhere around 0. 5 to 1. 0 degree Fahrenheit. This increase in your bodys temperature will last until your next menstrual cycle.
