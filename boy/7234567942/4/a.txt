She added, “There is no better way to tackle this than to take swift and immediate action. And so, as advised by my doctors, I am currently undergoing a course of treatment in New York. We remain optimistic and I am determined to fight every step of the way. What has helped has been the immense outpouring of love and support Ive received over the past few days, for which I am very grateful. Im taking this battle head-on, knowing I have the strength of my family and friends behind me.”
