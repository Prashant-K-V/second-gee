During these nine nights of the auspicious festival people generally observe fast, meditate and perform pujas of the Goddess to seek her blessings. Though Navratri is celebrated by Hindus throughout the country, the country celebrates this festival in different ways across different regions. For instance, in North India people celebrate Navratri by fasting and worshipping the Goddess. During the nine days stage plays depicting Lord Ramas story are performed, while on the eighth day Kanya Pujan is observed wherein minor girls, who are considered a form of Durga, are worshipped and offered food, sweets and gifts. In West Bengal, the last four days of Navratri is celebrated as Durja Puja. In Gujarat, men and women perform their folk dance, garba and dandiya, in honour of the Goddess.
