Navratri is made up of two words- Nav meaning nine and Ratri meaning night, and so the word Navratri literally translates to nine nights. Navratri is a Hindu festival which celebrates the nine avatars of Goddess Durga. There are two major Navratris which are celebrated by Hindus in a year-- the Vasant Navratri (it generally falls in March-April) and the Sharad Navratri (it generally falls in September-October). Devotees across the world celebrate this festival with great enthusiasm. It is believed that during these nine days, Goddess Durga descends on earth to bless her devotees. On the tenth day, devotees celebrate Dussehra or Vijay-Dashmi. It was on Vijay-dashmi when Goddess Durga killed demon Mahishasura, thus restoring Dharma in the universe. While the story behind Dussehra marks the victory of Lord Rama over Ravana, which signifies the victory of good over evil. Effigies of Ravana are burnt to celebrate Dussehra.
