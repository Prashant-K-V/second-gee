After taking a bath, devotees place a Kalash in front of Durgas idol. An earthen pot with mud is also placed to grow Khetri. One has to add barley in it, tie a red thread on the pot and water it regularly. Devotees believe that the barleys growth during the nine days of Navratri signifies the fortune and harmony it brings to ones house. Durga Chalisa is also read during these days.
