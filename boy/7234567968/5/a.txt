Black pepper is very good for exfoliation. If you make a powder of it and apply a paste on your acne marks and blemishes, it will help exfoliate the affected skin and give it a clearer appearance. It can also help in clearing pimples. A little curd can also be added to black pepper powder and applied for beauty benefits.
