Like women, the CTM routine (cleansing, toning and moisturising) is just as important for men. They are exposed to pollution, car exhaust, cigarette smoke and other pollutants on a daily basis, which damage the skin. Also, men tend to have oilier and thicker skin than women. They need to use a good facial cleanser that works on all kinds of skin.
