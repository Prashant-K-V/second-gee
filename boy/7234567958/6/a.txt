Another thing men tend to ignore is the sunscreen. You must apply a sunscreen with minimum SPF 30. It is not the heat that causes tanning but the sun rays that spoils the colour and texture of your skin. To minimize tanning, apply it on your face as well as hands. Make sure you apply the suncreen 15 minutes before heading out, so it gets absorbed better.
