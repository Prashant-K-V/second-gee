You need to pay attention to your lips as well. They also tan and get chapped and can look bad. A good lip balm is a must to cure all these problems; it also makes them soft and supple. Also, did you know that lips age with time? Look closely in the mirror, and you will notice the fine lines. As the years go by, the lips start looking chapped. Men dont have the advantage of makeup to hide this effect. They should always apply a lip balm with a high SPF during the day, and a hydrating and nourishing lip balm at night.
