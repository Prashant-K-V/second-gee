Exfoliation is crucial to eliminate dead skin cells from accumulating and causing bacterial infection on your skin. If you do not scrub your skin, your pores will build up dirt, causing your skin to break out more often. Acing the list of beauty tips for men is exfoliating the skin. Removing dead cells from the skins surface leaves the face radiant and healthy. Once a week, one should use a gentle but granulated face scrub to help smoothen the skin and eliminate dullness. Another advantage of exfoliating the face is that it softens the hair follicles, which results in a smoother shave and minimal irritation. For normal to combination skin type, use a cream-based scrub or a gel-based scrub to eliminate dirt from your face.
