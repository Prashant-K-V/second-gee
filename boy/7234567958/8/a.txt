The skin around the eyes, especially, lacks in sweat and oil glands; making it highly susceptible to under-eye dehydration. This manifests as fine lines and wrinkles eventually. To prevent this, dab a little hydrating eye cream around your peepers every morning and before bedtime. Choose from the various mens eye creams available in the market.
