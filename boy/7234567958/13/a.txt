Its perfectly fine to sport a beard, if you think that makes a style statement. But ensure that you keep it clean, so that fears about itchiness dont come between you and your loved one while you enjoy your conversation and meal. Simply follow a few basic hygiene measures. The best thing to do is to wash your beard with a face wash or shampoo. But ensure that you dont over shampoo your beard. It may completely remove natural oils that keep your beard healthy and moisturised. You may also apply some beard oil with fragrance after washing it.
