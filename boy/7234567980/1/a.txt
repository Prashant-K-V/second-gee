An hour before the beginning of the Times Fresh Face Season 11 audition at PES University, corridors were brimming with enthusiastic students filling up audition forms. “This is my first time and I have heard so much about the competition. Ill be performing Kathak and hope that the judge likes it,” said Yogadisha, a participant. From experimental freestyle to street style, moves like popping and locking, and Bhangra, the university stage witnessed several outstanding dance performances.

FROM THE JUDGES TABLE
Walking violinist Aneesh Vidyashankar, the celebrity judge, was looking for the complete package. “I heard that PES University has an awesome talent pool and was excited to see who emerges the winner. It was not easy to judge, as I witnessed some really good performances. If given proper guidance and training, those who have won have a lot of potential,” said the talented musician, who added, “The atmosphere was electrifying and it was great to see students cheering those on stage.”

AND THE WINNERS ARE
With many solid dance performances, winners Siri RJ and Prateek Doharey stood out thanks to their energy and moves. “Apart from becoming an engineer, I see myself being a professional dancer. This is my mothers dream,” said Siri, a trained Bharatanatyam dancer. Prateek, on the other hand, took us back in time to the Step Up movie with his street style dance moves. The second runner-up, Apoorva Choudhary, has been dancing since Class 6 and has never looked back. Apart from talent, her witty responses to the judges questions got her added praise. Sharing the same position was Utsav K Raj, who played some really cool music on his synthesiser. The first runners-ups were Aashruti Seervi and Girish Narayan S.
