She said, While mothers do play a very important role in taking care of their daughters post-pregnancy, the role of the partner cannot be neglected. Partners support is key in dealing with postpartum depression. What many dont know is that even fathers suffer from paternal postpartum depression. In fact, not long ago, it was considered a taboo in India for a father to be as involved as the mother in the upbringing of the baby. They were frowned upon if they changed diapers or fed the child in front of everyone.
