As doctors stress, it is extremely important for parents to take charge. Without a proper sleep cycle in place, kids turn to sugar and energy drinks to compensate for the same. Doing so leads to obesity which in turn, causes sleep apnea. So, its not just social media and phone usage that is causing kids to lose their sleep. Increased dependency on the phone and improper pattern also affects their mental health, making them more tired, grumpy, irritable.
