Blue light emission is one of the major causes of disturbed sleep. When the phone is kept on, high levels of blue light is emitted, which disrupts the bodys natural circadian rhythm. For kids who stay glued to the phone, with their necks crouched down playing a game or watching a video, melatonin, which is essential for a good sleep cycle is also disturbed.
