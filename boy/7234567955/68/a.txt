Kaalratri is the seventh figure of Goddess Durga that is worshipped on this day. She is supposed to protect all her devotees from evils. The goddess is beautifully dressed in a dark green colour on Durga Saptami when Utsav puja is performed by the devotees by wearing a white sari. Shraddha Jambhekar, a professor, said, “We prepare all the delicious food items that the Goddess loves on the days of Navratri to please and welcome her home and invoke her blessings upon us.“
