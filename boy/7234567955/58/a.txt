 12. The time of dandiya and garba has arrived again It is the blissful part of the year when Navratri brings along joy, love and merriment I pray to Goddess Durga to bless each one with her love and exorcise all negativity from our lives. I hope that today onwards, you find love, peace and happiness in every path and may never find deceit, lust and greed ever I hope that you have a glorious and blissful Navratri
